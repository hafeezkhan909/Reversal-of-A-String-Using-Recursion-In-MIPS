# Reversal-of-A-String-Using-Recursion-In-MIPS
The C code for the reversing of a string has been implemented in MIPS assemble language. 
For implementing a recursive fuction in MIPS, we make use of the stack pointer. As you observe the code, jal saves the return address (the address of the next instruction) in the dedicated register $ra, before jumping to the function. â€” jal is the only MIPS instruction that can access the value of the program counter, so it can store the return address PC+4 in $ra.

The MIPS code is run on [QTSpim environment](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/).
Initially the code is written in a file (example: NOTEPAD), and is saved with a .s extension. Then the code is run on the environment by reinitializing and loading the file.
